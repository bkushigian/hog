    "a. Go back to a working version if you mess up\n",

    "c. Share work with colleagues and collaborators\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Git repository?\n",
    "To track your project over time, Git has to store this data somewhere. Git uses a **repository** to track data about your project over time. Git does this by creating a _hidden directory_ in the root of your project called `.git/`. As a user you will rarely ever need to look inside of this\n"
