    "`git add` tells Git to track the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n",
    "* Work with temporary HOG-Sessions\n",
    "* Use `git add` to track an untracked file\n",
    "* Discuss what part of the `.git/` directory is changed by `git add`\n",

    "## The Basics of Git Add\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracked and Untracked files\n",
    "Recall from the [Basics of Git](git-basics.ipynb) lesson that there are on a high level two\n",
    "types of files in the Git universe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tracked files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Untracked files\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracked files are files that Git is storing some data about. As we will see, Git stores this data\n",
    "in a few different places; of note, information is stored in the _Git database_ (aka `.git/objects`)\n",
    "and in the _staging area_ (aka `.git/index`).\n",
    "\n",
    "An untracked file is one that Git knows nothing about; it doesn't store any data about it in the index and\n",
    "it doesn't have any information about its contents in stored in the database. This can often be useful. Here are\n",
    "some things that we usually don't want Git to track:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anything with **password** - this is critical infromation that should not be sent along\n",
    "2. Binary files, such as compiled code (Java class files, compiled C/C++ files, etc) - these can get large\n",
    "   and Git is not good at compressing these since it is built to work on human-readable text (i.e., code).\n",
    "   Also, since compiled code comes from the source code we can always recompile. This makes our life easier:\n",
    "   we only care about the source code!\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Additionally, image files, music files, video files, etc are often best kept elsewhere and downloaded\n",
    "   separately. However it will not be too noticable if a few images slip into the repo here and there\n",
    "3. Temporary files and one-off scripts\n",
    "4. Backup files generated by text editors\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we have a file and we've decided that we want to track it: that's where the `git add` command comes into play. But first, let's get ourselves a temporary Git repository set up!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To get set up for the exercise, go ahead and run the following two cells. This just gets us\n",
    "set up and ready to explore some cool Git stuff. Additionally, open up a new terminal."
